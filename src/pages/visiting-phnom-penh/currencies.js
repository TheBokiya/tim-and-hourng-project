        Cambodia uses two currencies, US Dollars(USD) and Khmer Riel(KHR). It
        can be confusing at first however, once you know the conversion rate,
        you should be good to go. 1 USD converts to about 4,000 KHR. You can use
        either currency while you're in Cambodia however, we do not use US coins
        here. So if you give 10 USD to buy an item that costs 9.50 USD, they
        will give you back your change in KHR of 2,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend exchanging for USD before flying over. If you happen to
        bring any other currencies, you can exchange them at the airport or any
        other local currency exchange shops in the city. The exchange rate is
        quite decent in these small stores. You can also exchange for USD or KHR
        at the bank however their rate is not so great. You can also withdraw
        from ATM machines all around the city, but please beware of the service
        charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of places also accept cashless payment, so you can use your
        credit/debit cards in majority of the big stores here.
