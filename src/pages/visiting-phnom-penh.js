              A lot of the ancient temples that you read about are located in
              Siem Reap and the most mavelous of all, Angkor Wat. It is the
              largest religious monument in the world by land area covering
              around 162 hectares. We highly recommend you spend at least 3 days
              in Siem Reap to see all the popular temples. On top of this,
              December and January are some of the coolest months of the year
              which is perfect for exploring temples.
